# Data Structures in Python

Understanding how to use certain data structures in our programming allows us to use the most efficient and best running solution for problems we tackle as programmers. Here are some tutorials for what some of these data structures are and how to use them to solve real problems.

- [Stacks](stacks.md)
- [Linked Lists](linked_lists.md)
- [Trees](trees.md)

Each tutorial will include definitions and explanations, with example code written in python showing you how to apply them. The end of the tutorial will have a practice problem for you to try. After you try the problem you can look at the solution to see a possibly different implementation.
